### INSTALLING FROM GIT

1. Clone the git repository to the location you desire using:

		git clone git://github.com/symphony/symphony-2.git
		
	Should you wish to make contributions back to the project, feel free to fork the
	master tree, instead of cloning, and issue pull requests via github.


	The following repositories are included as submodules:

	- [Select Box Link Field](http://github.com/pointybeard/selectbox_link_field)
	- [Export Ensemble](http://github.com/pointybeard/export_ensemble)
	- [Markdown](http://github.com/pointybeard/markdown)
		

3. Run the following commands to ensure the submodules are cloned:

		git submodule init
		git submodule update
		

4. _(Optional)_ If you would like the [default theme](http://github.com/symphony/workspace/tree) installed as well, 
you will need to use the following command from within the Symphony 2 folder you just created:

		git clone git://github.com/symphony/workspace.git
		

5. Follow from step 2 below


### INSTALLATION

** See further down for updating instructions **

1. This step assumes you downloaded a zip archive from the [Symphony website](http://symphony21.com). 
Upload the following files and directories to the root directory of your website:

	- index.php
	- install.php
	- /symphony
	- /workspace
	- /extensions

   _Alternatively, you can upload the `.zip` archive to the same location and
   run '`unzip`' from the command line._
	
   **Note: You can leave `/workspace` out if you do not want the default theme.**

2. Point your web browser at <http://yourwebsite.com/install.php> and provide
   details for establishing a database connection and about your server
   environment.

3. Celebrate!



### UPDATING

Updating requires you are running Symphony 2 Beta, revision 5.

1. Backup `/symphony/.htaccess` and `/symphony/lib/toolkit/fields/field.sectionlink.php`

2. Replace `/symphony`, `index.php` with those contained in this archive.

3. Put the backed up `.htaccess` file into the new `/symphony` folder

4. Put the backed up `fields.sectionlink.php` file into `/symphony/lib/toolkit/fields`
