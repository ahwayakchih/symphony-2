** IMPORTANT NOTE FOR GIT USERS **
If you intend on pulling the latest changes to update your copy of Symphony, be forewarned.
There have been some major structural changes and doing so will remove parts of your 
workspace folder. To get around this, move your workspace folder some place safe, along with
any of the extensions mentioned below in the "INSTALLING FROM GIT" instructions. Once you have
pulled the latest version, move the workspace folder back in place and use the following commands

	git submodule init
	git submodule update

The workspace folder will no longer be under git version control, which allows the Symphony
team to make alterations to the default theme without risking your ability to pull changes.
	
Finally, follow from step 4 below.


[UPDATING]

Follow the instructions below if you are updating from Symphony version 2.0 (non Git)

1. Backup /symphony/.htaccess

2. Upload /symphony, index.php & update.php, replacing what is already on your server.

3. Put the backed up .htaccess file into the new /symphony folder

4. Go to http://yoursite.com/update.php to complete the update process.

5. Dance like it's 1999!



[INSTALLING FROM GIT]

1. Clone the git repository to the location you desire using:

		git clone git://github.com/symphony/symphony-2.git
		
	Should you wish to make contributions back to the project, feel free to fork the
	master tree, instead of cloning, and issue pull requests via github.


	The following repositories are included as submodules:

		- Maintenance Mode: http://github.com/pointybeard/maintenance_mode
		
		- Select Box Link Field: https://github.com/pointybeard/selectbox_link_field
		
		- Export Ensemble: http://github.com/pointybeard/export_ensemble
		
		- Markdown: https://github.com/pointybeard/markdown
		

3. Run the following commands to ensure the submodules are cloned:

		git submodule init
		git submodule update
		

4. (Optional) If you would like the default theme (http://github.com/symphony/workspace) 
installed as well, you will need to use the following command from within the Symphony 2 
folder you just created:

		git clone git://github.com/symphony/workspace.git
		

5. Follow from step 2 below


[INSTALLATION]

** See further down for updating instructions **

1. This step assumes you downloaded a zip archive from the Symphony website 
   (http://symphony21.com). Upload the following files and 
   directories to the root directory of your website:

     - index.php
     - install.php
     - /symphony
     - /workspace
     - /extensions

   (Alternatively, you can upload the .zip archive to the same location and
   run 'unzip' from the command line.)
	
   Note: You can leave /workspace out if you do not want the default theme.

2. Point your web browser at http://yourwebsite.com/install.php and provide
   details for establishing a database connection and about your server
   environment.

3. Celebrate!
